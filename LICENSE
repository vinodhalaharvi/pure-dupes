3. Use of this software may result in:
   - Excessive abstraction.
   - Recursive thought patterns.
   - Sudden urges to refactor everything into monads.
   - Prolonged exposure to natural transformations.
   - Explaining things to colleagues using diagrams in the air.

4. Categorical Theory may cause:
   - Brain expansion.
   - Loss of interest in imperative programming.
   - Addiction to purity, composition, and elegance.

5. If your brain starts to functor-map itself into higher dimensions,
   please take a break, touch some grass, and remember:
   not everything is a morphism (probably).
